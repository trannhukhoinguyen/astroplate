description: "Now, the practitioner of Zen must contemplate the koan, also called Seeing the Koan. 
Seeing means to look, to look right at the beginningless ignorance, ignorance means darkness, not knowing what it is. 
Looking and asking, the more you ask, the more you feel you don't know, that is called developing doubt. 
From now on, you only need to sleep and wake up to rectify your mind, ask yourself where is the ultimate master of this consciousness? 
Also, do not stop your wandering thoughts, you should use your eye faculty to look straight into that deep, dark pit that does not abide in existence or non-existence, walking, standing, lying down, sitting without interruption. Set your body and establish your life, vow to change a life of ignorance, determined to see that clearly."
