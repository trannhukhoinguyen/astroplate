    <h4>1. What is Patriarch Zen?</h4>
  </Tab>
  <Tab name="REPLY">
    * It was passed down from the Patriarch, so it was called Patriarch Zen. From India, Dharma transmitted it to China, people called it Dharma Zen. This meditation was personally transmitted by Shakyamuni Buddha, not through written words and words. All Buddha spoke in the scriptures were through written words and spoken words.
    During the Linh Son Assembly, the Buddha held up a flower branch, Kasyapa just smiled, the Buddha did not say anything, so this dharma is "a teaching transmitted separately from outside without writing".
    * In the Zen Patriarch's Way of Practicing Contemplation, there are the first 5 lines, choose the one you find most difficult to understand to study, and finally Buddha nature appears, which is called seeing the nature and becoming Buddha. Because directly from the ordinary person's position, attaining Buddhahood is also called direct meditation.
    The brain's knowledge is not the same throughout space and time. About space, we know this place but don't know there. About time, sometimes we know and sometimes we don't know. The knowledge of Buddha nature is true knowledge (correctness is true to reality, variation is universal in space and time, knowledge is knowing) throughout space and time, there is no time of not knowing, no place of not knowing .
    The knowledge of Buddha nature is never lost, but is obscured by the knowledge of the brain so it does not appear.

    * Buddha taught us to practice meditation to suppress the knowledge of the brain so that the knowledge of Buddha nature can appear. What the brain knows about time is when it falls asleep and doesn't know, when it dies, it doesn't know, and when it's dead it doesn't know. The one who knows the Buddha nature is still known even when sleeping, and is still known when dead; If you die and don't know, there will be an interruption, so it's not the same throughout time, it's not the knowledge of Buddha nature, it's not called perfect enlightenment.
    The knowledge of the brain gives the appearance of illness, the knowledge of Buddha nature is the appearance of strength; If the illness persists for a long time, the strong appearance will not appear.
    Why? Because the appearance of illness is pale yellow and weak, the appearance of health is rosy; Now this face is pale and sickly yellow, how can it appear rosy? The sickly green and yellow must be gone before the rosy color will appear.
    Therefore, thanks to the first line, doubts arise to wipe out the knowledge of the brain, allowing the knowledge of Buddha nature to appear.
    - Which opening line did you choose to refer to?
    - Choose the sentence: What is not mind, not Buddha, not thing?
    - Now let me ask if you are greedy or not. As I said, if you want to suppress the brain's knowledge, you must not let the brain think, not let the brain understand, not let the brain explain the first line, just Night and day, keeping doubts (not knowing), wearing clothes, eating, going to the toilet, working... all ask silently in the heart to arise not knowing.

    * As soon as I finish asking a question, answer immediately. If it's a little late, your thinking brain will think that the answer to my question is no, that's doubt, not right doubt.
    Right doubt allows the mind to doubt, not for the mind to learn, not for the brain to think.
    I ask you to answer immediately: What is not mind, not Buddha, not things?
    If you don't answer right away, your brain will think too much. If you want to find an answer, you won't be able to.
    Please ask me again!
    He asked: What is not mind, not Buddha, not things?
    - Don't know.
    Not knowing is meditation, just not knowing without thinking and finding out. If you can understand it, it is the knowledge of the brain, not the knowledge of Buddha nature.

    * The sudden knowing of Buddha nature is called enlightenment. The meaning of the word Buddha is enlightenment, enlightenment is manifesting one's Buddha nature.
    Meditation means that if you want to manifest the knowledge of Buddha nature, you must destroy the knowledge of the brain. People say, "If you remove knowing, how will your brain work?" Also works normally. Like Ms. Hang Thien, a seamstress, when meditating, her brain didn't know, she also finished cutting the shirt, until her younger brother asked how many inches or inches?
    She answered that she didn't know. Unreasonable! Don't know how to cut? But the truth is that people sew, she measures the measurements and writes them down in the book. When she starts cutting, suspicions arise, but she still cuts the shirt without having to think about it; that is, using the knowledge of Buddha nature to work.
    - Proves that the brain doesn't know how to still get the job done, but it does it even better. Like newly invented clothing styles, others can't cut them or it's very difficult to cut them; Also, you don't need to research, just watch and cut because there's no need to go through the brain.
    - Prove your instincts throughout space and time, you can do anything. Bats have no eyes but fly without touching objects because they have radar; The scientist studied the bat's radar and then made the radar.

    * The other day, I watched station number 50, there was a scientist who tested a very good bat radar, he knew it even if he wasn't reading a book, he also knew how to count money, people were singing loudly in the house and it didn't affect his photography work. mosquito. Bats do not learn and do not research, because of the karma of bats, every bat has a radar.
    Bees have architectural knowledge, birds eat fish in the sky, fish swim in the sea with big waves, but in space they immediately capture the fish.
    Every child is the same, you don't have to learn it, you know it, it's already there by instinct. The inherent instinct is to just follow the karma a little bit, in your Buddha nature appears limitless, there is nothing that cannot be done.

    * Meditation is about discovering your instincts and using them, not becoming a god. If you meditate, just ask the first line silently, feeling like you don't know, then you're done. Children as young as 6 or 7 years old can practice, and old women as young as 8 or 90 years old can meditate. Because what the world wants to know is very difficult, but what the world doesn't know can be done by anyone.
    However, believing in one's own mind is very difficult. One must believe in one's own mind that all the magical powers and wisdom are equal to those of Shakyamuni Buddha, nothing less.
    If you meditate until you realize your nature, you will end all negative habits and gradually the benefits will appear, and in the end you will be like Shakyamuni Buddha.
    At that time there was nothing unknown, there was never a time when it was unknown, not that the brain's knowledge was limited and inauthentic.

    <h4>2. Ask the first dialogue you want to understand and how to answer it?</h4>
  </Tab>
  <Tab name="REPLY">
    When meditating, you don't use your brain to investigate, just ask silently in your heart. If you ask, you must have an answer.
    If you don't understand the question, you won't be able to answer it. You will be very angry. If you ask again, when the answer suddenly comes out, it will be enlightenment.
    The answer doesn't come from the brain trying to figure it out, the answer comes from suddenly lighting up everywhere
    Time and space, that is, the essence appears, not answered by words.
