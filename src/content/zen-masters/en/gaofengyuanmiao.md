ZONG. Gaofeng was a native of Suzhou in present-day Jiangsu province. He was
ordained at the age of fourteen and two years later began his studies of
TIANTAI thought and practice under Fazhu (d.u.) at the monastery of Miyinsi. He later
continued his studies under Chan master WUZHUN SHIFAN’s disciples
Duanqiao Miaolun (1201–1261) and Xueyan Zuqin (1215–1287). Gaofeng
trained in Chan questioning meditation (看話禪 KANHUA CHAN), and Xueyan Zuqin
taught him the necessity of contemplating his meditative topic (HUATOU) not
just while awake, but also during dreams, and even in dreamless sleep. (In his
own instructions on GONG’AN practice, Gaofeng eventually used the same
question Zuqin had asked him: “Do you have mastery of yourself even in
dreamless sleep?”) In 1266, Gaofeng went into retreat at Longxu in the Tianmu
mountains of Linan (in present-day Zhejiang province) for five years, of
which he is said to have had a great awakening when the sound of a falling pillow
shattered his doubt (YIQING). In 1274, he began his residence at a hermitage on
Shuangji peak in Wukang (present-day Zhejiang province), and in 1279 he began
teaching at Shiziyan on the west peak of the Tianmu mountains. He subsequently
established the monasteries of Shizisi and Dajuesi, where he attracted hundreds of
disciples, including the prominent ZHONGFENG MINGBEN (1263–1323). He
was given the posthumous title Chan Master Puming Guangji (Universal
Radiance and Far-reaching Salvation). Gaofeng is most renowned for his
instruction on the “three essentials” (SANYAO) of kanhua Chan practice: the
great faculty of faith, great fury, and great doubt. Gaofeng’s teachings are
recorded in his discourse record, the Gaofeng dashi yulu, and his GAOFENG
HESHANG CHANYAO*, better known as simply the Chanyao (“Essentials of
Chan”; K. Sŏnyo), which has been a principal text in Korean monastic seminaries
since at least the seventeenth century. Gaofeng is also known for his famous
gong’an: “Harnessing the moon, the muddy ox enters the sea.”
