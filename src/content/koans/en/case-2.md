- Joshu, instructing the assembly, said, _"The supreme Way is not difficult; it simply dislikes choosing **[1]**. However even if a word is uttered, it is already an action of 'choosing' or of adhering
to 'clarity'. This old monk **[2]** doesn't dwell in clarity. Do you monks want to keep a firm hold on 'clarity' or not?"_.

- At that time a monk asked, _"You say you do not dwell in clarity. If so, what is there to keep a firm hold on?"_.

- Joshu said, _"I don't know, either."_

- The monk said, _"If you, Master, don't know, why do you say that you don't dwell in clarity?"_

- Joshu said, _"You have already asked amply. Bow and withdraw"_.

"The supremet Way is not difficult; it simply dislikes choosing. Only if there is no love or hatred, all is complete clarity."

> **[2]**: "this old monk" i.e. "I"
