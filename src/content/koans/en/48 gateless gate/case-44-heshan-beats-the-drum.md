### Case 44
Basho said to the assembled monks, “If you have a staff, I will give you one. If you have no staff, I will take it away from you.”

### The Commentary
It helps you when you wade across a river, when the bridge is broken down; it accompanies you when you return to the village on a moonless night. But if you call it a staff, you will go to Hell swifter than an arrow.

### The Verse
The deep and the shallow everywhere Are all within my grasp.
It holds up the sky and the earth;
In every place it spreads the True Doctrine.
