### Case 41

Daruma’s Mind-Pacifying
Daruma sat facing the wall. The Second Patriarch, having cut off his arm, stood there in the snow. He said, “Your disciple’s mind has no peace as yet. I beg the Teacher to give it rest.” Daruma replied, “Bring your mind here and I will give it rest.” The Patriarch said, “I have searched for that mind, and have not found it.” Daruma said, “Then I have put it to rest”

### The Commentary
The broken-toothed old foreigner crossed the sea importantly from a hundred thousand miles away. This was raising waves when there is no wind. Daruma had only one disciple, and even he was a cripple. Well, well!

### The Verse
Coming from the West, and direct pointing,— All the trouble comes from this!
The jungle of monks being all at sixes and sevens Comes from these two chaps.
