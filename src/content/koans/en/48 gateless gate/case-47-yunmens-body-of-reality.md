### Case 47
Tosotsu made three barriers, asking the monks: Getting rid of your illusions and penetrating into the truth is done by seeing into your nature. At this moment, where is your nature? When you realize what your nature is, you are free from life, free from death. When the light of your eyes is falling, how can you be free from them? If you have freed yourself from life and death, you know where you are going. When the Four Elements separate, where are you off to?”

### The Commentary
If you can say the three passwords, you are master wherever you may be. If you are not yet able to do so, coarse food we get tired of! and it is difficult to be hungry after well-digested food.

### The Verse
One thought fills immensity; To see eternity in an hour.
If we see through this thought, We see through the thinker of it.
