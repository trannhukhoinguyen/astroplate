### Case 22

Kasho’s Flag Pole
Anan asked Kasho, “The World-Honored One transmitted to you the surplice of golden cloth; did he transmit anything else to you? Kasho called him and said, “Anan!” “Yes?” said Anan. “Knock down the flag pole at the gate” said Kasho.

### The Commentary
If you can give a “turning-word” in regard to all this, you will see
the meeting at Mount Grdhrakuta still in session. If not, then however much you “struggle against the light” from the age of Vispasyin, you cannot even now gain the Essence.

### The Verse
The question, how dull! The answer, how intimate! How many people there are with a film over their eyes!
The elder brother calling, the younger brother answering, the family skeleton! This is a spring that does not belong to Yin and Yang.
