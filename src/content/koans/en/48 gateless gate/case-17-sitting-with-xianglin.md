### Case 17

Echu’s Three Calls
The National Teacher called the attendant three times, and three times he answered. The National Teacher said, “I thought I had transgressed against you, but it seems that you have transgressed against me.”

### The Commentary
The National teacher called three times. His tongue fell to the ground [from talking too much]. The attendant answered three times, sending out a corresponding glory. The National Teacher, getting old and lonely, pushed the cows head down to the grass. The attendant would have none of it; delicious food is not suitable for a man who is satiated. Just say, in what did the transgression consist? When the country is prosperous, rich children are too proud [to eat plain food].

### The Verse
He must carry the hole-less iron cangue,
And his descendants too can have no peace or rest.
If you wish to support your religion and cause it to flourish You must climb a mountain of swords with your bare feet.
