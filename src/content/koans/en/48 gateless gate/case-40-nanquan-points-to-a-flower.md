### Case 40

Isan’s Bottle
When Isan was with Hyakujo he was the tenzo. Hyakujo wanted to choose a master for Mount Daii, so he called the head monk and the rest of them, and told them that an exceptional person should go there. Then he took a water-bottle, stood it on the floor, and asked a question. “Don’t call this a water-bottle, but tell me what it is!” The head monk said, “It can’t be called a stump.” Hyakujo asked Isan his opinion. Isan pushed the water bottle over with his foot. Hyakujo laughed, and said! “The head monk has lost.” Isan was ordered to start the temple.

### The Commentary
Isan was a valiant man of the time,5 but he could not spring out of Hyakujo trap. Comparatively speaking, Isan leaned towards the difficult, and away from the easy. Why do I say this? Because he removed the towel from his head and put on an iron cangue.

### The Verse
Tossing away the bamboo utensils, and the wooden ladle, Isan immediately cuts off obstructions.
The barrier Hyakujo set up for Isan did not stop him; With his feet he overturns the Buddha like flax.
The tips of his feet radiate the Buddha like flax.
