### Case 48
A monk said to Kempo, “The Bhagavat of the ten directions have one road to Nirvana. Where, may I ask, does that road begin?” Kempo lifted up his stick, drew a line, and said, “Here”. Later, the monk asked Ummon’s help. Ummon held up his fan, and said’ “This fan has jumped up to the thirty third Heaven, and hit the nose of the Deity there. The Carp of the Eastern sea gives one stroke, and it rains cats and dogs.”

### The Commentary
One goes the bottom of the deep sea,and, scratching in the dirt, raises dust. The other goes to the top of the highest mountain, and raises foaming waves that touch the sky. One grasping, the other releasing! with his one hand each sup ports the deep doctrine. They are just like two riders, neck and neck. In this world, such people who grasp truth directly are difficult to find. But if we look at these two great teachers with a true eye, neither of them really knows where the Nirvana road is.

### The Verse
Without raising a foot, we are there already;
The tongue has not moved, but the explanation is finished. Though each move takes the initiative,
We must know the final checkmate.
