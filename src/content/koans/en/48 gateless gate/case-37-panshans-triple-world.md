### Case 37

Joshu’s Oak Tree
A monk asked Joshu, “What did Daruma come to China for?” Joshu answered, “The oak tree in the temple front garden.”

### The Commentary
If you grasp Joshu’s answer clearly and strongly, there is for you no former Sakyamuni Buddha, or Maitreya Buddha to come.

### The Verse
Words do not express things;
Phrases do not show the mind-movement. He who receives (only) words is lost;
To stagnate with sentences is to be deluded.
