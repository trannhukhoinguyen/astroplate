### Case 19

Nansen’s Ordinary Mind
Joshu asked Nansen, “What is the way?” Nansen answered, “Your ordinary mind,-that is the way.” Joshu said, “Does it go in any particular
direction?” Nansen replied, “The more you seek after it, the more it
runs away.” Joshu: “Then how can you now it is the way?” Nansen: “The way does not belong to knowing or not knowing. Knowing is illusion.
Not knowing is lack of discrimination. When you get to this perplexed way, it is like the vastness of space, an unfathomable void, so how
can it be this or that, yes or no?” Upon this Joshu came to a sudden realisation.

### The Commentary
Joshu suddenly brought up the question to Nansen, who explained it, but the tile disintegrated, the ice dissolving, the drain is blocked
up. Even though Joshu came to a realisation, he must delve into it another thirty years before he can understand it fully.

### The Verse
The spring flowers, the moon in autumn, The cool wind of summer, winters snow,
If your mind is not clouded by unnecessary things, This is the happy day in human life.
