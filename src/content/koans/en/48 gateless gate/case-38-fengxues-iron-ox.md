### Case 38

Goso’s Cow
A reddish-yellow cow passes by a window. The head and horns and the four legs go past. Why doesn’t the tail too?

### The Commentary
If in regard to this, you are able, even when in a hurry, to fix your one eye on it, and say a turning-word, you will be able to repay the Four Obligations and help the Three Bhava. If you are still unable to do this, reflect again on the tail, and you can do it.

### The Verse
If the cow goes through, it will fall into a ditch; If it goes back it will be destroyed.
This little bit of a tail,— What a marvellous thing it is!
