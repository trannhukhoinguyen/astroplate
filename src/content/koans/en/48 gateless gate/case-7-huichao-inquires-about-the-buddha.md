### Case 7

Joshu’s Washing the Bowl
A monk said to Joshu, “I have entered this monastery. I beg you to teach me” Joshu asked. “Have you eaten your rice-gruel.” “I have,” replied the monk.”Then”, said Joshu, “go and wash your bowl(s).” The monk was enlightened.

### The Commentary
Joshu opened his mouth and showed his gallbladder, his heart, and his liver. If the monk didn’t really grasp the truth, he mistook the bell for a pot.

### The Verse
He made it all so clear,
It takes a long time to catch the point.
If you realize that it’s foolish to look for fire with a fire The meal won’t take long to cook.
