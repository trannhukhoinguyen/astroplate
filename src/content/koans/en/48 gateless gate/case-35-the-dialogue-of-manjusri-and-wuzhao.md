### Case 35

Goso and Sei’s Soul
Goso asked a monk, “Sei’s being separated from her soul, which was the real person?”

### The Commentary
If you are enlightened concerning what real things are! you will know that we pass from one husk to another like travellers in a night’s lodging-house. But if you are not enlightened, don’t rush about wildly. Suddenly earth, water, fire, and air are separated,and! like a crab with its seven arms and eight legs in boiling water [you struggle!]. Don’t say I didn’t warn you!

### The Verse
The moon among the clouds is ever the same; Valleys and mountains are in constant change. What a happy thing it all is!
This is one! that is two.
