### Case 24

Fuketsu’s Speech & Silence
A monk asked Fuketsu, “Both speech and silence transgress; how can we not do so?” Fuketsu said, “I often think of Konan in march; The partridge chirps among the scented flowers.”

### The Commentary
Fuketsu’s activity of mind is like lightning. He has his road, and walks along it. But why does he not avoid relying upon the tongues of the ancients? If you are kind enough to express your view of the matter, there is a way out; leave all words and phrases behind, and say something!

### The Verse
Fuketsu did not make his own fine sentence,
But though he did not explain, the answer is there. If Fuketsu had gone on talking and chattering, The monk would not have known what to do.
