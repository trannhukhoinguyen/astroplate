### Case 18
Tozan’s Flax
A monk asked Tozan, “What is the Buddha?” He replied, “Three pounds of flax.”

### The Commentary
Old Tozan’s Zen is rather like a clam; when it just opens the two halves of the shell, you can see the liver and the intestines. But though this may be so, just say, where can we see Tozan?

### The Verse
“Three pounds of flax,” -artlessly, spontaneously it comes out. The words and the meaning are intimate, indivisibly so.
He who explains this and that, yes and no, the relative, Is himself [only] a relative man.
