### Case 8

Keichu’s Wheel
Gettan said to a monk, “Keichu made a hundred carts. If we took off the wheels and removed the axle, what would then be obvious?”

### The Commentary
To clarify this, one’s eye will be like a shooting start, his response like a flash of lightning.

### The Verse
Where the wheel of the mind-activity turns Even a master doesn’t know what to do about it. It moves in all directions in heaven and earth, And south and north and east and west.
