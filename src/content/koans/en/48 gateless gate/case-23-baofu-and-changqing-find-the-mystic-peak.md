### Case 23

Eno’s Good & Evil
The 6th Patriarch was pursued by Monk Myo up to Daiyurei. The Patriarch, seeing Myo coming, laid the robe and the bowl on a rock, and said to him: “This robe represents the faith; is it to be fought for? I allow you to take them away.” Myo tried to lift them up, but they were as heavy as a mountain; they would not budge. Hesitating and trembling,he said, “I came for the Doctrine, not for the robe. I beg you to teach your servant!” The Patriarch said, “Do not think, ‘This is good!, This is bad!, At such a moment, what is the Original Self of Monk Myo?” At this, Myo was all at once greatly enlightened; his whole body was covered with sweat. With tears flowing he made obeisance, and asked, “Beside the secret words and the secret meaning is there anything else, deeper still?” The Patriarch answered,“You have realised your True Self, and anything deeper belongs to you alone,’ Myo said, “When I was at Obai together with the other monks, I never realised what my true self was. Now I have received from you instruction. It is like a man drinking water himself, and knowing whether it is cold or warm. You are my master!” The Patriarch said, “We both have Obai for our teacher. Hold fast to what you have learned from him!”

### The Commentary
The Sixth Patriarch should say that this is a state of emergency, needing grandmotherly kindness. It is like peeling a fresh lichi, removing the pips, and then putting it in your mouth for you. All you have to do is just to gulp it down.

### The Verse
You describe it in vain, you picture it unavailingly; Praising it is useless; stop trying to apperceive it! There is nowhere to hide your true self;
When the universe is annihilated, this remains, indestructible.
