### Case 45
Hoen of Tozan said, “Shaka, Miroku, are the servants of another. Tell me, who is this “Another”?

### The Commentary
If you get to know clearly who this Other is, it is like knocking into your pa at the cross-roads. Why should you ask someone else whether it is he or not?

### The Verse
Do not draw Another’s bow; Do not ride Another’s horse; Do not speak ill of Another;
Do not enquire into Another’s business.
