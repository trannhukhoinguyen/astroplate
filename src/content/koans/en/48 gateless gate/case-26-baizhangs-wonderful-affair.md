### Case 26

Two Monks Blind-Rolling
Hogen of Seiryo went to the hall to speak to the monks before the midday meal. He pointed at the bamboo blinds. At this moment, two monks went and rolled them up. Hogen said, “One has it, the other hasn’t.”

### The Commentary
Tell me, which one profited, which made a loss? If your eye is single, you will realise that Teacher Seiryo failed. Nevertheless, I am not making the mistake of dealing with profit and loss.

### The Verse
When they are rolled up, the great sky is bright and clear, But the great sky has no affinity with Zen.
To have nothing to do with the sky is better, And never let the wind through.
