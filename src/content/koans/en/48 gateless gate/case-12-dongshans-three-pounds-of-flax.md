Case 12

Zuigan’s Calling the Master
Every day Zuigan (Shi)gen used to call to himself, “True Self!” and would answer “Yes?” “Awake! Awake!” he would cry, and “Yes! Yes! he would answer. “From now onwards, do not be despised by others, do not let them make a fool of you!” “No, I will not!”

The Commentary
The master, Zuigan, himself sells and himself buys. He has a lot of puppets of gods and devils that he plays with. For what reason? Look and see! A calling one, an answering one, one that says, “Wake up!” and one that will not be looked down. But you must not stick to [these appearances] for that is your former mistake. And imitating others [e.g. Zuigan] is only the mental disguise of a fox.

The Verse
Those is search of the Way do not realize the existence and true nature of the self;
This is because they recognize only the relative mind, Which is the origin of our eternal transmigration; Foolish people take it for the true original self.
