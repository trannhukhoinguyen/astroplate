### Case 39

Ummon And Trap Into Words
As soon as a monk stated, “The radiance of the Buddha quietly and restlessly illuminates the whole universe”, Ummon asked him, “Are these you are reciting not the words of Chosetzu Shusai?” The monk replied, “Yes, they are.” Ummon said, “You are trapped in words!” Afterwards Shishin brought up the matter once more and said, “Tell me, how was the monk trapped in words?”

### The Commentary
If you are able to grasp Ummon’s unapproachable accomplishments and follow through the monk’s corruption (of being trapped into words), you will be the leader of humans and Devas. If not, you cannot even save yourself.

### The Verse
A fish meets the fishhook in a rapid stream,
Being too greedy for the bait, the fish wants to bite. Once his mouth widely opens,
His life is already lost.
