### Case 34

Nansens No Way
Nansen said, “The mind is not the Buddha; knowledge is not the Way.”

### The Commentary
Nansen, growing old, was lost to shame. Just opening his stinking mouth, he told others about the disgrace of his own house. However, we must say that few are grateful for it.

### The Verse
The weather is fine, and the sun appears; Rain falls, and the earth becomes wet.
With exceeding kindness he explains everything, But how few have faith in his words!
