### Case 16
Ummon’s Seven Fold Robe
Ummon said, ”The world is vast and wide; for what is it you put on your seven-piece robe at the sound of the bell?”

### The Commentary
In general, learning the way and grasping Zen means avoidance of attachments to sound and forms. Though through hearing a sound there may be realisation, or from seeing the form of an object the mind may be enlightened, nevertheless this is the ordinary way of things. Especially you Zen monks do not understand how to guide sound, use form, see clearly the value of each thing, each activity of the mind. But though this is so, just tell me! Does the sound come to the ear, or does the ear go to the sound? But when sound and silence are forgotten, are both forgotten, what can you say of this state? If you listen with your ear, it is hard to hear truly. But if you listen with your eye, then you begin to hear properly.

### The Verse
If you are enlightened, all things are as though of one great family. But if not, everything is separate and disconnected.
If you are not enlightened [it makes no difference anyway because] all things are as of one great family. And if you are enlightened [this also makes no difference to reality, in which] every single thing is different from every other things.
