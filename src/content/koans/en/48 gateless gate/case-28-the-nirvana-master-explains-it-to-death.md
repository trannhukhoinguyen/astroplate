### Case 28

Ryutan’s Candle
Tokusan went one night to Ryutan to ask for his teaching. At last Ryutan said, “It is late; you had better go back.” Tokusan made his bows, lifted the blind and went out. Seeing how dark it was outside, he came back in, and said, “It’s dark out there” Ryutan lit a lantern and handed it to him. Tokusan was about to take it, when Ryutan blew it out. At this Tokusan was enlightened. He made obeisance. “What have you realised?” asked Ryutan. Tokusan replied, “From now on l will not doubt what you have said.” The next day Ryutan ascended the rostrum and declared, “Among you there is a chap whose fangs are like the sword-tree! his mouth a blood-bowl. Strike him with a stick, he won’t turn his head to look at you. Some day or other he will climb the highest of all peaks and establish my Way there.” Tokusan then made a bonfire of his commentaries on the sutras in front of the Hall, and declared, “All the most profound teachings are like a single hair in vast space. The farthest extreme of human wisdom is a drop of water thrown into a deep ravine.” Having burnt up all his notes he took his departure.

### The Commentary
Before Tokusan passed the barrier [of his native place] his mind was eager, his mouth was anxious, with a purpose in his mind, he went south, to confute the doctrine of “A special transmission outside the sutras.” When he got on the road to Reishu he asked an old woman to let him have something to “point his mind.” The old woman said, “Your worship, what’s all that writing you are carrying?” Tokusan said, “That’s the manuscript of my notes and commentary on the Diamond Sutra!” The old woman said! “In that sutra it says, ‘Dispositions of mind, or modes of thought, whether relating to the past, the present, or the future, are alike unreal and illusory. Which of these minds is your worship intending to point?” That question was a poser for

Tokusan. Nevertheless, not giving up in despair to the old woman’s words, he asked her! “Is there a Zen master near here?” “About five li away lives Ryutan’ she replied. He arrived at Ryutan’s quite deflated.

It must be said that the former words and the latter words were inconsistent. Ryutan took pity on him quite shamelessly. Seeing that Tokusan had some fire of knowledge, Ryutan should have violently thrown muddy water over his head. Looking at the whole affair impartially, it was all just a farce.

### The Verse
Rather than hearing the name, seeing the face is better; Rather than seeing the face, hearing the name is better. But however much you help the nostrils,—
Look what you’ve done to the eyes!
