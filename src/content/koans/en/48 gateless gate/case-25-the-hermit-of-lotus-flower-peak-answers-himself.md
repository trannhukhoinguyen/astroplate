### Case 25

Kyozan’s Dream Sermon
Kyozan dreamed a dream. He thought he went to Maitreya’s place, and sat down in the 3rd seat. A monk there struck with a gavel and said, “To- day, the sermon is to be given by the one in the 3rd seat” Kyozan stood up, struck with the gavel and said, “The truth of Makaen is beyond the Four Propositions and transcends the Hundred Negations. Hear the Truth!”

### The Commentary
Now tell me, did Kyozan preach, or did he not? If he opens his mouth, he is lost; if he shuts it he is lost. If he neither opens it nor shuts it, he is a hundred and eight thousand miles away from reality.

### The Verse
In broad daylight,
He expounds a dream, while yet a-dream. Bogie of bogies,
He is just upsetting the whole congregation.
