### Case 32

Buddha & the Non-Buddhist
A Non-Buddhist said to the Buddha, “I do not ask for words; I do not ask for silence.” Buddha just sat quietly. The Non-Buddhist said admiringly, “The compassion of the World-Honoured One has opened the clouds of my illusion, and has enabled me to enter on the Way” Making his salutations, he departed. Ananda then asked Buddha, “What was it this Non-Buddhist realised, that he so praised you” The World-Honoured One replied, “A high-class horse moves at even the shadow of the whip.”

### The Commentary
Ananda was the Buddha’s disciple, but his understanding was nothing like that of the Non- Buddhist. Just tell me, what is the distance between disciples and non-disciples?

### The Verse
Walking along the edge of a sword; Running over jagged ice;
Not using a ladder;
Climbing precipices handless.
