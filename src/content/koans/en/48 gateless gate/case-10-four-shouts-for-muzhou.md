Case 10

Sozan and Poor Seizei
A monk, named Seizei by name, said to Sozan, “I am a poor destitute monk. I beg you to bestow upon me the alms of salvation.” Sozan Said, “*Acarya Seizei!” “Yes, Sir?” replied Seizei. Sozan said, “Someone has drunk three bowls of the wine of Haku of Seigen, but asserts that he has not yet moistened his lips.”
*Acarya means teacher, master, and is here a term of respect.

### The Commentary
Seizei is obsequious, but what is his real state of mind? Sozan, with his Buddha-eye, sees into the recesses of it, and understands the visitor’s meaning. But however this may be so, just tell me, where and why does Acarya Seizei drink this wine?

### The Verse
His poverty is like Hanzen’s; His spirit like that of Kou.
Though he has no commercial system, They are quarreling about riches.
