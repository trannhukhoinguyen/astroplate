### Case 31

Joshu’s Old Women
A monk of Joshu’s asked an old woman the way to Taizan. She said! “Go straight on.” After the monk had taken three or five steps, she said, “This monk also goes off like that.” Afterwards, another monk told Joshu about this, and Joshu said, “Wait a bit; I’ll go and investigate this old lady for you.” The next day off he went, and asked the same question and got the same reply. On returning, Joshu said to the congregation of monks, “I’ve investigated the old lady of Taizan for you.”

### The Commentary
The old woman just sat still in her tent and planned the campaign; she didn’t know that there was a famous bandit who knew how to take the enemy commander prisoner. Old Joshu was clever enough to steal into her camp and menace her fortress, but he wasn’t a real general. Ponder ing over the matter, we must say that they both had their faults. Tell me now, what was Joshu’s insight into the old woman?

### The Verse
The question is the same. The answer is the same. Sand in the rice,
Thorns in the mud.
