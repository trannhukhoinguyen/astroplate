### Case 20

Shogen’s Strong Man
Shogen said, “Why is it that a man of great strength cannot lift up his own leg?” [Or, “Why does an enlightened man not stand up for Zen?”] And again, “It is not with our tongue that we speak.”

### The Commentary
It must be said that Shogen shows us his whole soul, but there is no one to receive it. If there should be anyone who can actually can do so, let him come to me, Mumon, and be beaten with many blows. Why these blow? If it is wished to know true gold, see it in the midst of
fire.

### The Verse
Raising my foot to kick up the Scented Ocean,
Lowering my head I look down on the four Dhyana Heavens. My body is so big there’s nowhere to put it;
Please finish this verse yourself!
