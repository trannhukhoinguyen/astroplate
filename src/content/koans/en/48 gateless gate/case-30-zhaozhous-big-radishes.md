Case 30

Baso’s Very Mind
Daibai asked Baso, “What is the Buddha?” Baso answered, “The mind is the Buddha.”

The Commentary
If you have grasped Baso’s meaning, you are wearing Buddha’s clothes, eating Buddha’s food, speaking Buddha’s words, doing Buddha’s deeds, that is to say, you are Buddha himself. But though this may be so, Daibai has misled not a few people into mistaking the mark on the balance for the weight itself. He doesn’t realise that if we explain the word “Buddha” we must rinse out our mouths for three days afterwards. If he had been a man of understanding, when he heard Baso say, “The mind is the Buddha!” he would have covered his ears and rushed away.

The Verse
It is broad daylight, a fine day; It is silly to rummage around, And asking about the Buddha
Is like declaring oneself innocent while holding on to the stolen goods.
