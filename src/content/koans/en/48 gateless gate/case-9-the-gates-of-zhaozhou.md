### Case 9

Daitsu Chisho
A monk asked Seijo of Koyo and said, “Daitsu Chisho Buddha did zazen for ten kaplas in a Meditation Hall, and could neither manifest the truth, nor enter the Buddha-Way. Why was this?” Seijo said, “Your
question is a very appropriate one.” The monk persisted, “Why did he not attain Buddhahood by doing zazen in the Meditation Hall?” Seijo replied, “Because he didn’t.”

### The Commentary
You may know the Old Indian, but you are not to analyse him psychologically. An ordinary man who really knows him is a sage, but a sage who has merely discursive knowledge of him is only an ordinary man.

### The Verse
Rather than putting the body to rest, rest of heart! If the mind is at peace, the body knows no grief.
But if both the mind and body are pacified, thoroughly, as one, This is the life of perfect sainthood, where praise is meaningless.
