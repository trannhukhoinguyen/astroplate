### Case 46
Sekiso said, “How can you go on further from the top of a hundred-foot pole?” Again, an ancient worthy said, “One sitting on the top of a hundred-foot pole Has entered the Ways but is not yet the real thing. He must go on further from the top of the hundred-foot pole, And reveal his true self in the ten directions.”

### The Commentary
Going on beyond the top of the pole and turning his body about, what is there here to dislike or to praise? But even so, tell me, how we proceed onwards from the top of a hundred-foot pole? Aha!

### The Verse
If the third eye in the forehead is darkened
And we mistake the star on the balance for the measurement, We throw away our body and soul
And blindly lead other blind people.
