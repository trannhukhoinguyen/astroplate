### Case 43
Master Shuzan held out his bamboo spatula and asked, “If you call this a bamboo spatula, you give umbrage (to the principle of Zen). If you call this no bamboo spatula, you violate the law (of common-sense). What will all of you call this?”

### The Commentary
Should you call this a bamboo spatula, you would give umbrage. Should you call this no bamboo spatula, you would betray the law. Both to speak out will not do, and no word will be of any use either. Quickly say, quickly say!

### The Verse
Bringing out the bamboo spatula,
Shuzan demanded the order? of life or death. Being put to either the umbrage, or the betrayal,
Even Buddha and Patriarchs would beg for their lives.
