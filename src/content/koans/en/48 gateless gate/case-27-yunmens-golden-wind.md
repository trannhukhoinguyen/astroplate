### Case 27

Nansen’s No Mind, No Buddha
A monk asked Nansen. “Is there a truth which no one has taught?” Nansen replied, “There is.” “What is this truth,” said the monk, “which no one has so far taught?” Nansen answered, “It is not mind; it is not Buddha; it is not things.”

### The Commentary
Nansen was just asked a question, and,— at once used up all his treasure, decrepit old chap!

### The Verse
Too kind, Nansen lost his value; What an effect no-words has!
The blue ocean may change,
But Nansen has simply made everything more incomprehensible.
