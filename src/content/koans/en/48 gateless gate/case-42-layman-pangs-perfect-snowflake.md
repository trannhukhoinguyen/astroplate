### Case 42

The Buddha & The Lady
Once, in ancient times, Manjusri went into the presence of the World-Honoured-One where all the Buddhas assembled, but they had all departed to their original dwelling-places. A single woman was there, close to Buddha’s throne, in the deepest meditation. Manjusri said to the Buddha “How is it that this woman is so close to your throne, and I cannot be?” The Buddha spoke to Manjusri and said, “You may awaken this woman from her deep meditation, and ask her yourself how this can be.” Manjusri walked round her three times, snapped his fingers once, (and could not wake her, so he) took her up to the Brahman Heaven, and practiced all his magic art upon her, but could not bring her out of her deep meditation. The World- Honoured-One said, “Even a hundred thousand Manjusri’s could not get her out of her concentrated condition. But down below, past twelve hundred million countries, as innumerable as the sands of the Ganges, there is a Bodhisattva named Momyo. He will be able to awaken this woman from her profound meditation” Thereupon Momyo emerged out of the earth, and bowed to the World-Honoured-One, who told him what he wanted him to do. Momyo went before the woman, snapped his fingers once, and at this she came out of her meditation.

### The Commentary
The drama Old Sakya puts on the stage is a great hotchpotch. Just tell me now, Manjusri is the teacher of the Seven Buddhas; why couldn’t he get the woman out of her samadhi, when Momyo, a beginner, could? If you can understand the reason for this without discrimination, while living a busy life of worldly affairs, you will ever be in the Dragon Samadhi.

### The Verse
One could awake her, the other couldn’t; Both have their own freedom.
There is a god-mask, and a devil-mask; The failure was very interesting.
