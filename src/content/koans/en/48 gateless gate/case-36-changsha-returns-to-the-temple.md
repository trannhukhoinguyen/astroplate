### Case 36

Goso’s no Word no Silence
Goso said “When you meet a man of the Way on the way, do not greet him with words; do not greet him with silence; tell me, how will you greet him?

### The Commentary
If you can answer Goso intimately, you are to be congratulated on your genius; but if you can’t, you must endeavour to look at everything you come across.

### The Verse
Meeting a master on the way,
Do not use words, do not be wordless! Give him an uppercut,
And as for understanding, he’ll understand at once!
