### Case 29

Eno’s Flag
The wind was flapping a temple flag, and two monks were having an argument about it. One said the flag was moving, the other that the wind was moving; and they could come to no agreement on the matter, however they argued back and forth. The Patriarch said, “It is not that the wind is moving; it is not that the flag is moving; it is that your honourable minds are moving” The two monks were struck with awe.

### The Commentary
It is not the wind that moves, it is not the flag that moves, it is not the mind that moves. How shall we understand the Patriarch? If you have a close grasp of the meaning, you will see how the two monks, intending to buy iron, got gold. The Patriarch could not repress his compassion, and so we have this disgraceful scene.

### The Verse
The wind moves, the flag moves, the mind moves, All confirmed as guilty of error.
We know we open our mouths,
But we don’t know we go all wrong.
