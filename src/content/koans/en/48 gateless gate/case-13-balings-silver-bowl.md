Case 13

Tokusan’s Bowl
One day Tokusan came towards the refectory from the Meditation Hall, carrying his bowls. Seppo called out to him, “Where are you off to with your bowls, when the bell has not rung and the drum has not been struck.” Tokusan went at once back to his room. Seppo told this occurrence to Ganto, who remarked, “Tokusan though he is, he has no penetrated into the deepest truth, the last word of Zen.” Hearing of this, Tokusan sent an acolyte to ask Ganto to come, and said to him, “Have you any criticism to make of me?” Ganto whispered his meaning to him. Saying nothing Tokusan took leave of him. The next day ascending the rostrum, Tokusan was different then before. Ganto, going towards the front of the Hall, clapping his hands and laughing, said, “What a happy thing! The old man has got the last word of Zen. From now onwards nobody will be able to take a rise out of him!”

The Commentary
As for what is called “The Last Word of Zen”, neither Ganto nor Tokusan ever heard of such a thing. When you look into the matter, they’re only a set of puppets.

The Verse
If you understand the first word of Zen You understand the last;
But these two words Are not one word.
