### Case 14

Nansen’s Cat-Killing
Once, when the monks of the Western and Eastern Halls were quarrelling about a cat, Nansen, holding up the cat, said, “You monks! if any of you can speak a word of Zen I will spare the cat, otherwise I will kill it!” No one could answer, so Nansen killed it. In the evening, Joshu came back from somewhere, and Nansen told him what had happened. Joshu thereupon took off his shoe, put it on his head, and walked off. Nansen said, “If only you had been there, I could have saved the cat!”

### The Commentary
Just say, what is the meaning of Joshu putting his shoe on his head? If you can express the meaning of his words and actions, they were not in vain, but if not, you are in danger.

### The Verse
If Joshu had been there,
Everything would have been done the other way round. He would have snatched away the Knife,
And Nansen would have begged for his life.
