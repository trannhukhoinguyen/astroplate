### Case 33

Baso’s no Buddha
A monk asked Baso, “What is the Buddha?” Baso answered, “Not mind, not Buddha.”

### The Commentary
If you understand what Baso said, your study of Zen is at an end.

### The Verse
If you meet a master-swordsman in the street, give him a sword. If you meet an unpoetical man, don’t offer him a poem.
When you meet someone, tell him three quar ters, Don’t on any account let him have the other part.
