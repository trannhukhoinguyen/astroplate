### Case 15

Tozan’s Stripes
Tozan came to learn from Ummon, and was asked by him “Where have you come from?” “From Sato,” he replied. “Where were you during the summer?” “I was at Hoji Temple in Konan Province.” “When did you leave there?” “On the twenty fifth of August.” Ummon burst out, “A beating is what you want!” The next day Tozan came and knelt before Ummon, and said, “Yesterday I was to be beaten by you. I did and said nothing I shouldn’t. What did I do wrong?” Ummon said, “You dirty big belly bag! What did you come from Kozei and Konan for?” Suddenly Tozan came to a realization.

### The Commentary
If Ummon at that time, by giving him the fodder of the sect, had shown him that One Way of Living Activity, it would not of become extinct. All night long Tozan wallowed in the waves of the sea of Yes and No until he could get nowhere, and, when long-awaited dawn broke, again went to Ummon, and had his eyes opened by him, and was suddenly enlightened, but he was not a seasoned man yet. Now I ask all of you: Was Tozan’s being beaten right or wrong? If it was right, then everything in the universe should be beaten; if it was wrong, then Ummon was a swindler. If you understand this clearly, then you and Tozan breathe the same air.

### The Verse
The lion has a round-about-way of teaching her cubs. Intending to urge them on she kicks them away.
And they soon redress themselves and charge back. Heedlessly he came back to Ummon but was checkmated;
The first arrow was only a scratch, but the second one went deep.
