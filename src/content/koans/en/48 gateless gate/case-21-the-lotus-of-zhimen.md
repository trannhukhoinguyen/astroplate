### Case 21

Ummon’s Shit-Stick
A monk asked Ummon, “What is the Buddha?” “It is a shit-wiping stick,” replied Ummon.

### The Commentary
We must say that Ummon can’t appreciate plain food. He’s so busy he can’t even scribble properly. He is disposed to support the sect with
a shit-stick. Look at the outcome!

### The Verse
Sudden flashes of lightning! Sparks from iron striking flint! A blink of the minds eye,
And the legs are already walking in different directions.
