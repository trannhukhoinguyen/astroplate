Towards the end of summer [1], Suigan instructed the assembly, saying,
"All summer I've preached to you, my brothers. Look here, are Suigan's
eyebrows still there? [2]"
Hofuku said,
"The robber's heart is terrified!"
Chokei said,
"They are well grown!"
Unmon said,
"Kan!" [3]

[1]: Summer-sesshin for 3 months.
[2]: According to the popular belief a great criminal should lose his eyebrows
as a sign of his coming punishment in hell.
[3]: Literally kan means "barrier" (cf. Mumonkan). In those days this Chinese
word colloquially meant also, "Watch out!" or "There!"
