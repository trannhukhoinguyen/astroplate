- Towards the end of summer **[1]**, Suigan instructed the assembly, saying, _"All summer I've preached to you, my brothers. Look here, are Suigan's eyebrows still there?"_ **[2]**
- Hofuku said, _"The robber's heart is terrified!"_
- Chokei said, _"They are well grown!"_
- Unmon said, _"Kan!"_ **[3]**

***

> **[1]**: Summer-sesshin for 3 months.

> **[2]**: According to the popular belief a great criminal should lose his eyebrows
as a sign of his coming punishment in hell.

> [3]: Literally kan means "barrier" (cf. Mumonkan). In those days this Chinese
word colloquially meant also, "Watch out!" or "There!"
