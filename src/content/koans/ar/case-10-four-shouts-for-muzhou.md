- Bokushu asked a monk, _"Where have you come from?"_
- At once the monk shouted, _"Kaatz!"_
- Bokushu said, _"The old monk has been scolded by you with a 'Kaatz'!"_
- The monk shouted again, _"Kaatz!"_
- Bokushu said, _"After three or four shouts of 'Kaatz', then what?"_
- The monk was silent.
- Bokushu hit him saying, _"You idiot!"_
