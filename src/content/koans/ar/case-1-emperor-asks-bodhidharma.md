- Emperor Bu of Ryo **_[1]_** asked Great Master Bodhidharma, _"What is the highest meaning of the holy reality?"_

- Bodhidharma replied, _"Clear and void, no holiness!"_.

- The emperor said, _"Who are you in front of me?"_

- Bodhidharma said, _"I don't know!"_.

* The emperor did not match him. Finally, Bodhidharma crossed the Yangtse River and came to the kingdom of Gi.

- Later, the emperor asked Shiko for his view. 

- Shiko said, _"Does Your Majesty know who this man is?"_

- The emperor said, _"I don't know!"_

- Shiko said, _"He is the Mahasattwa Avalokitesvara transmitting the seal of Buddha's Mind"_.

* The emperor regretted and wanted to send an emissary to invite Bodhidharma back. 

- Shiko said, _"Your Majesty, do not intend to send an emissary to fetch him back. Even if all the people in the land were to go after him, he would not return"_.
